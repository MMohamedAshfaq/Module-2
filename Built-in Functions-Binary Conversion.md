# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
~~~
a = 16
binary_representation = bin(a)
print("The binary representation of", a, "is", binary_representation)
~~~

## Output
![2 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42cd8939-dc15-4c50-8910-8347609d71bd)

## Result
Thus, the program has been successfully executed.
